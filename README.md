# Renting_Parking_Spaces_Program_Manager
This is a simple program I did for a client who owns a company who rents out parkings spaces around two cities in Colombia. This program enables my client to organize his business, identify the available parking spots each day and rent out those which are available. With this program my client was able to increase his efficiency and automate many processes which were previously done manually. For example; my client was able to easily add, remove and see the available parkings spaces in his business, through different organized files which showed each of the parking spaces depending on different factors such as: city and available days for rental (weekdays or weekends).
For further information of the program functionalities, planning process and evaluation, see the documents within this repository.
