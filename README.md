# Renting_Parking_Spaces_Program_Manager
This is a simple program I did for a client who owns a company which rents out parkings spaces around two cities in Colombia. This program enables my client to organize his business, identify the available parking spots each day and rent out those which are available. With this program my client was able to increase his efficiency and automate many processes which were previously done manually. For example; my client was able to easily add, remove and see the available parkings spaces in his business, through different organized files which displayed and stored each of the parking spaces depending on different factors such as: city and available days for rental (weekdays or weekends). As well, with this program my client was able to easily assign parking spaces to his clients and even calculate how much he needed to charge depending on the type of space, day of rental and amount of days which the client needed the parking space. Overall, this program he;ped my client to make his daily task easier, faster, safer and more efficient than before. 

For further information of the program functionalities, planning process and evaluation, see the documents within this repository.
